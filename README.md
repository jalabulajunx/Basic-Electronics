## 🔌 Overview

Electricity Explorer is designed to help kids understand fundamental electricity concepts through hands-on, interactive demonstrations. Each section features animated visualizations and playful interfaces that make abstract concepts tangible and engaging.

Perfect for curious 10-year-olds (and their parents!) who want to learn how electricity works without the complexity of traditional textbooks.

## ⚡ Features

- **Interactive Demonstrations** - Watch electrons flow, see capacitors charge/discharge, and observe how resistors affect current
- **Visual Learning** - Colorful animations bring abstract concepts to life
- **Hands-On Circuits** - Adjust voltage, resistance, and other values to see immediate effects
- **Kid-Friendly Explanations** - Complex ideas explained in simple, approachable language
- **Fun Quizzes** - Test knowledge with interactive challenges

## 📚 Chapters

- **Introduction to Electricity** - Understand electrons, voltage, current, and resistance
- **Resistors** - Learn about resistance, color codes, and circuit configurations
- **Capacitors** - Explore energy storage, charging/discharging, and capacitor types
- **Inductors** - Discover magnetic fields, inductance, and coil properties
- **Circuits** - Combine components into functional circuits
